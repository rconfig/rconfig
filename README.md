<!-- Installation -->

<a name="setup"></a>

## Installation

We have made it super easy to get started with rConfig v6. Follow the steps below to get started. Check out our youtube channel for a video walkthrough of the installation process.

[https://www.youtube.com/channel/rconfigV6Core](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dpV2hQIDLR04p5RuJEVcdhQY1gXKOgU)

> [!NOTE]  
> Do not follow the installation steps to update existing rConfig installations. You must skip to the <a href="#update">Updating</a> section below.

### Prerequisites

Setup a server with one of the supported OS's listed above. We recommend using a fresh install of the OS. If you are using a server that has been in production, we recommend you backup the server before proceeding.

You will need to install the following software on your server:
Git 2.25+
PHP 8.4+
Composer 2.4+
Apache 2.4+
MySQL 5.7+ or MariaDB 10.5+
nodejs 14.17+
Supervisor 4.2+

We have conveniently provided scripts to help you install the required software. Head over to [https://docs.rconfig.com/getstarted/os-setup](https://docs.rconfig.com/getstarted/os-setup) to find the correct script for your OS. If you are using a different OS, you will need to install the required software manually.

> **Note**
> You will need to be logged in as root when running the scripts.

### Database Setup

1. Login to your database server as root
2. Create a new database

```sh
mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE rconfig;
```

3. Create a new user if required (do not use the credentials below in production). This is likely required for Ubutnu 20.04+. If you are using a different OS, you may not need to create a new user, and you can use the root account, though this is not recommended.

```sh

CREATE USER 'user1'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password1';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON rconfig.* TO 'user1'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

4. Exit the database

```sh
exit
```

### rConfig Setup Steps

1. Login as root
2. Clone the repo

```sh
cd /var/www/html
git clone https://github.com/rconfig/rconfig.git
```

3. Change directory to the repo

```sh
cd rconfig
```

4. Create the .env file

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

5. Edit the .env file and update the following variables:

```sh
APP_URL="https://SERVER.DOMAIN.LOCAL"
APP_DIR_PATH=/var/www/html/rconfig
DB_HOST=DBHOST
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=DBNAME
DB_USERNAME=DBUSER
DB_PASSWORD=DBPASS
```

6. Install the required PHP packages

```sh
export COMPOSER_ALLOW_SUPERUSER=1
composer self-update --2
yes | composer install --no-dev
```

7. Install apache and supervisor

```sh
chmod +x setup_apache.sh
./setup_apache.sh
```

8. Install supervisor

```sh
chmod +x setup_supervisor.sh
./setup_supervisor.sh
```

9. Run the installation script. This will install the required packages, setup the database, and configure the web server. The script will take a few minutes to complete.

> [!WARNING]  
> Do not run the next command on existing rConfig deployments in an attempt to update. You must follow the instructions in the <a href="#update">Updating</a> section below. The command below is for new installations only.

```sh
php artisan install
```

If you area asked 'Add a cron entry for task scheduling?', type `yes` and press enter.

The output from the above should look like this:

```sh


                                         APPLICATION INSTALL.

   INFO  Install done!

```

10. Update apache config file for correct server name.

```sh
# CentOS/RHEL
sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/rconfig-vhost.conf
```

```sh
# Ubuntu
sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/rconfig-vhost.conf
```

Update the `ServerName` to match your server's domain name.

```sh
ServerName YourServerName.domain.local
ServerAlias YourServerName.domain.local
```

11. Restart apache

```sh
# CENTOS/RHEL
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

```sh
# Ubuntu
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

12. Clear the cache & reset permissions

```sh
# CENTOS/RHEL
cd /var/www/html/rconfig
chown -R apache storage bootstrap/cache
php artisan rconfig:clear-all
```

```sh
# Ubuntu
cd /var/www/html/rconfig
chown -R www-data storage bootstrap/cache
php artisan rconfig:clear-all
```

13. Open your browser and navigate to your server's domain name. You should see the rConfig login page. The default system credentials are below. Please change or remove these as soon as a new admin user is created.

Username: admin@domain.com
Password: admin

## Updating

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Your advised to backup your database, .env file and storage directory at a minimum before proceeding. You should also backup your entire server if possible.

Instruction on how to update your installation of rConfig v6 Core are below. You should run the commands below as root, and you may need to use sudo if installed on Ubuntu.

> [!WARNING]
> If you edit any of the files in the rConfig directory, you may need to resolve conflicts when you run the `git pull` command. You should be familiar with git and how to resolve conflicts. If you are not, you should not edit any of the files in the rConfig directory. If you get a warning about conflicts, you can try a `git stash` and `git pull` to resolve the conflicts. If you are not familiar with git, you should seek help from a professional.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> As of Feb 2024, you will need to update PHP to version 8.4 when updating rConfig Core V6. You will also need to update the composer version to 2.4. You can do this by running the following commands:

```sh
# Update PHP CentOS/RHEL/ Rocky
cd /home
yum -y install wget
wget https://dl.rconfig.com/downloads/php-updates/centos-php8-update.sh -O /home/centos-php8-update.sh
chmod +x centos-php8-update.sh
./centos-php8-update.sh

# Update PHP Ubuntu
